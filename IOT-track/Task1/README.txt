I have created four HTML files, which they have the the four action directions (f,s,l,r).
And host them on my Github account as an online server. Why I did this? Because I am using the Wokwi simulator and it cannot see my localhost server (XAMPP), I had to look for another solution to demonstrate how my ESP32 code can pick the correct action (that we should retrieve from the database in the real scenario) and turn on the correct LED. 

I have used four LEDS. The RED for the forward action. The Green for the Backward action. The orange for the Left and the the purple for the Right action. I have attached the Wokwi project. and Couple of png screenshots proof that the code is working correctly.
