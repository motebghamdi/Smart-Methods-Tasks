The task is to create a trained model for object detection that can be used by the robot. 
Using https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/, I created Six classes that could the robot face. Persons, Stairs, Tables, Doors, streets, and Cars. I collected the datasets as photos then I upload those photos to the designated classes on the teachable machine website. After that, I trained and tested the Model. The model was able to identify most of the tested photo classes. 

I have attached JS-Model-Code and the teachable machine project (zip files). Also, I have attached the data set and the test photos, and two samples from the test (the screenshots photos).
