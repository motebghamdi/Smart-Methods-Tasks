The task is to create trained model for object detection that can be used by the robot. 
Using the https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/, I created Six classes that could the robot face. Persons, Stairs, Tables, Doors, streets and Cars. I have collected the datasets as photos then I upload those photos to the designated classes in the teachable machine website. After that I have train and tested the Model. The model was able to identify most of the tested photos classes. 

I have attache JS-Model-Code and The project (zip files). Also I have attached the data set and the test photos, and two sample from the test (the screenshots photos).
